## 1. About the Project

**Kaching!** is a gamified financial wellness application designed to promote financial literacy among Filipino youth. Despite the increasing need for financial knowledge, only 25% of Filipinos are financially literate, with youth particularly affected. Kaching! addresses this gap by offering an interactive, relatable, and emotionally supportive experience that teaches budgeting, saving, and investing in a fun way.

Key features include:

- 🧠 **AI Financial Guide (Finni):** Provides real-time guidance, explanations, and encouragement to help players understand financial concepts.
- 👤 **Character Customization:** Players can personalize their avatar with gender selection, hairstyles, eye colors, skin tones, clothes, and pants.
- 🎯 **Gamified Learning:** Engaging quests, mini-games, and quizzes teach practical money management skills.
- 💰 **Rewards & Shop System:** Players earn Kaching Coins through gameplay, which can be exchanged for avatar items and bonuses.
- 🏆 **Special Events:** Limited-time financial literacy events, such as the BPI x Kaching! Financial Quest.

The game is built in Unity with PlayFab handling account management, authentication, and data storage. The financial literacy content is mapped to three core themes:

1. 💾 **Saving and Goal-Setting** – Encourages setting aside money for future needs.
2. 📊 **Budgeting and Needs vs. Wants** – Challenges players to prioritize and make trade-offs.
3. 📈 **Basic Investing and Responsible Spending** – Introduces risk, return, and informed decision-making.
